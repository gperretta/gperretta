<h2>About me</h2>
Hi! I'm Gilda, an endless learner who's passionate about tech and innovation.
<br>On September 2022, I was drawn by my insatiable curiosity to attend the Apple Developer Academy Learner Program (2022/23), where I've found an innovative environment based on creative thinking and teamwork. üçé <br>In the meanwhile, I've also completed my studies, becoming a Computer Engineering graduate on May 2023. üéì
<br><br>I've mostly explored object-oriented programming, relational databases and a few other notions (AI, OS, networking & statistics) during my university years and I've got to know something more about software lifecycle, practicing with back-end development as iOS developer and game developer (iOS/macOS)
<br>I am now eager to broaden my perspective about software engineering & development, looking forward to new challenges.
